Export layers as files with layernames
Javascript, PhotoshopComments Off

Edit a Photoshop scripting jsx file to export each layer as seperate file, with the layername as filename.

Today I needed to export every layer in a photoshop document as files. Photoshop has a default script for this. You can find it here: file -> scripts -> Export Layers to Files.

The only drawback is that the filename is composed from a prefix + number + layer name. And I want only the layername. What we have to do is edit the ¡°Export Layers to Files.jsx¡± file. This is a javascript file that we can edit.

mac: /Applications/Adobe/Adobe\ Photoshop\ CS4/Presets/Scripts/
win: C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS3\Presets\Scripts
Then open the file and search for ¡°fileNameBody +=¡± and edit:

1
2
3
var fileNameBody = fileNamePrefix;
fileNameBody += "_" + zeroSuppress(i, 4);
fileNameBody += "_" + layerName;
to:

1
2
var fileNameBody = fileNamePrefix;
fileNameBody += layerName;
You have to make sure there are no duplicate layernames otherwise the script will overwrite these files. If you don¡¯t want to edit this file you can download my version.
